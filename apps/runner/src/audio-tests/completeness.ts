/**
 * Response completeness test — verifies agent doesn't cut off mid-sentence.
 *
 * Procedure:
 * 1. Ask the agent a question that requires a substantial response
 * 2. Record and transcribe the full response
 * 3. Check if the response ends with proper sentence structure
 * 4. PASS if response is complete, FAIL if truncated
