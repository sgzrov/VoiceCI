/**
 * Adaptive silence threshold for end-of-turn detection.
 *
 * Adjusts the silence threshold between conversation turns based on
 * observed agent response cadence — prevents cutting off agents that
 * pause mid-response (thinking, tool calls, multi-sentence answers)
 * while keeping fast agents snappy.
 *
 * Key signal: maxInternalSilenceMs from CollectionStats.
 * If the agent had a mid-response pause that was close to the threshold,
 * we're at risk of premature cutoff on the next turn → increase.
 * If pauses are consistently short → decrease toward base.
