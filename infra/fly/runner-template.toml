# Runner Machine Template
# This is NOT deployed as a Fly app — it's used as a reference
# for the Fly Machines API when spawning ephemeral runners.
#
# The worker uses these settings programmatically via the
# Fly Machines REST API (createMachine in apps/worker/src/fly-machines.ts).

# Runner specs:
#   cpu_kind: shared
#   cpus: 1
#   memory_mb: 1024
#   auto_destroy: true
#   restart_policy: no
#   image: registry.fly.io/voiceci-runner:latest
#
# Required env vars (set by worker):
#   RUN_ID
#   BUNDLE_KEY
#   BUNDLE_HASH
#   MODE
#   API_CALLBACK_URL
#   RUNNER_CALLBACK_SECRET
#   S3_ENDPOINT
#   S3_BUCKET
#   S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
#   S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#   S3_REGION
